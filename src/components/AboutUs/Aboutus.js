        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}> Could green on the plate, bring green to the tummy? That was the question 5 young men asked 
            when they left a restaurants after some half cooked broccoli.

            we have been serving the community with Vegetarian food that have left them craving for more!
            No matter the location, we have always strived to not only represent local vegetarian cuisine, 
            but vegetarian cuisine from around the world so we and our customers can celebrate the Leaf, 
            the Land, and the Love all together. We also support and Empower he Local community with our

            different from our competitors. For more information about any of our services, 
            the answers are all on this website. See for yourself, if green on the plate,
